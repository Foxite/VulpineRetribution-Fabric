## Vulpine Retribution
Are your friends killing foxes? Installing this mod is a simple solution.

No amount of armor, quantum suits, totems of undying, creative mode or straight up cheating will let them get away with it.

If you install this mod on a server, then clients do not need the mod nor Fabric installed for it to work. If there are no other mods, or the other mods permit it, then clients can be vanilla.

Built for Minecraft 1.16 with Fabric. Should probably work on most Fabric versions. Feel free to ask for a backport.
### License
This mod is licensed AGPL 3.0. The short version is that if you distribute a fork of this mod, you must also distribute the source code.
Notably, under Affero, hosting a server with this mod installed constitutes distribution.

### Modpack permission
Granted.

### Disclaimer
No foxes were harmed in the making of this mod. I did kill several chickens and a sheep. See VulpineRetribution.java, line 16 for more details.
